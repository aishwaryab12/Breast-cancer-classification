Decision table are algorithms whose output is a set of actions. The information 
expressed in decision tables could also be represented as decision trees 
or in a programming language as a series of if-then-else and switch-case 
statements.

    Decision Table is an accurate method for numeric prediction from decision 
    trees and it is an ordered set of If-Then rules that have the potential 
    to be more compact and therefore more understandable than the decision 
    trees. Selection to explore decision tables because it is a simpler,
    less compute intensive algorithm than the decision-tree based approach.

     Decision Table builds a decision table majority classifier. It evaluates 
     feature subsets using best-first search and can use cross-validation 
     for evaluation. An option uses the nearest-neighbour method to determine 
     the class for each instance that is not covered by a decision table entry, instead
     of the tableâ€Ÿs global majority,based on the same set of features.
