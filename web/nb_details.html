    In machine learning we are often interested in selecting the best 
    hypothesis (h) given data (d).In a classification problem, our 
    hypothesis (h) may be the class to assign for a new data instance (d).
    One of the easiest ways of selecting the most probable hypothesis 
    given the data that we have that we can use as our prior knowledge 
    about the problem. Bayes’ Theorem provides a way that we can calculate
    the probability of a hypothesis given our prior knowledge.

Bayes’ Theorem is stated as: 
 
P(h|d) = (P(d|h) * P(h)) / P(d) 
Where 
</p>
<br>
P(h|d) is the probability of hypothesis h given the data d. This is called the posterior probability. 
<br>
P(d|h) is the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true. 
<br>
P(h) is the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data). This is called the prior probability of h. 
<br>
P(d) is the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis). 
<br>
<p>
After calculating the posterior probability for a number of different hypotheses, you can select the hypothesis with the highest probability. This is the maximum probable hypothesis and may formally be called the maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis.
